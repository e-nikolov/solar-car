Is it necessary to express that for all other actions in req3 and req7, the state remains unchanged?


req 9 

An activateCruise(s) cannot happen without a preceding getSpeed(s)

getSpeed(0) cannot be followed by activateCruise(x), without a getSpeed(n) in between

pressThrottle(n) cannot be followed by activateCruise without a releaseThrottle in between.
